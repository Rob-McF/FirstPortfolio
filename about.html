    <h2 id="about" class="right">About me</h2>
    <p class="pright">I'm based in Edinburgh Scotland and spent a good portion of my life living abroad. I'm looking to
        broaden my horizons and learn to code so that I can move into
        becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. I'm currently enrolled with the University of Edinburgh in partnership with
        HyperionDev to pursue my interest in coding.</p>

<br>
    <h2 id="hobbies" class="left">Hobbies</h2>
        <p class="pleft">I enjoy trekking and going for long walks when the weather is nice and I'm also into music, film and
            technology. My favourite genre of music is technical/progressive metal though I also like ambient electronic
            music. My favourite films are the classics but I also enjoy seeing modern films with their huge budgets and
            use of cutting edge CGI. </p>
